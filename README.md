# wxCreator
This project likely won't be updated and maintained in future. I had a big plans with this project in the begining, before realizing that what I want to achive already done in qtCreator. Use it for moving widgets and copy the coordinates to your code - for formatting, use wxFormBuilder. A lot easyer.

Another alternative wxWidgets form creator/editor. This editor is in very early state, if it will be required i'll further improve it. The main reason I created it is I missed moving widgets in wxFormBuilder with mouse, now it's possible with this editor.
